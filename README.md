* Today is the day of enlightment for me :fire: since one of my friend name vikas told me about his friend savan who has changed 
  his life just by doing the basic things and frankly speaking I knew all of those things but still i find it hard to achieve my goals
  live the life of my dreams so the question is why this is happening.
  
* First I will list the things that matters a most
  1. Belief --> affirmations --> achive some goals using those affirmations --> it will improve your belief
  2. Yoga --> yoga contains everything such as meditation or physical or hath yoga --> this will help me control
            my monked mind.
   
   
* So how I am planning to take down things in my life the way I am planning is i always wanted to be a software enginner 
and an elite performing person in sports 

* For the software developer I will remind myself every single day that I have become a software developer and imagine the life of software developer
* I have started believing myself now and My end goal is now mid of october i will have my OCP certification.
* for the masturabation and porn addiction I have decided i will switch off my phone every single day at 9:30 and then read and sleep.
